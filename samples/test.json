    "prompt": "CMV: The American Right is not more pro-free-speech than the American Left\nFor some reason, \"free-speech\" has become a buzzword rallying cry for American Rightists, despite the fact that I see no substantive attempt to implement public policy that would protect or expand free speech. In fact, I have really only seen the opposite.\n\nThe only free-speech related legislation I have seen in the past several years were laws *restricting* speech by conservative politicians. Many states have passed anti-BDS laws or executive orders that prevent the state from doing any business with corporations who engage in a Boycott against Israel, despite the fact that economic boycotts and the promotion thereof is a SCOTUS recognized aspect of free speech. [Texas even required teachers to sign anti-BDS oaths](https:\/\/www.middleeastmonitor.com\/20181218-texas-teacher-fired-for-refusing-to-sign-anti-bds-oath\/), and fired those who refused.\n\nMost stunningly, in Florida, [Ron DeSantis passed an anti-\"Critical Race Theory\" law which prohibited the teaching of any curriculum that would make a student feel \"discomfort\"](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/florida-doubles-anti-critical-race-theory-legislation\/story?id=82348795) (this is literally what the law said) or guilt on the basis of their race, even in *universities*. Banning speech that might make people feel discomfort sure doesn't feel free-speechy to me, and it was actually struck down by the courts because it violated the First Amendment. The Don't-Say-Gay bill also removed any books that even mention sexual orientation or gender identity, which you might agree with, but is still limiting speech.\n\nRon DeSantis also wants to make it a crime to bring a minor to a Drag Show. Again, you might agree, but free speech. I think it's more abusive to take your kids to church and teach them that they'll burn in a lake of fire for eternity if they don't follow your religion, but I don't prohibit parents from taking their children to church because I \\*actually\\* believe in free speech and familial autonomy, which the Republicans are clearly more comfortable limiting. (Also, there's no congruent effort to ban kids from Hooters and other titty bars. Seems like they are selectively choosing what free expression to limit based on their political feelings).\n\nWhile all these anti-speech bills are being passed by Republicans, I don't see any laws being passed by Republicans to protect speech, nor do I see any Democrats passing laws which would restrict it. The only \"free speech\" point I can give Republicans is that they are supporting a wedding planner who doesn't want to do sell a website template to a gay couple on the basis of her free expression, but that's about it.\n\nIt seems to me that Republicans aren't really concerned with free speech, but just want to be able to say slurs without being sent to HR, or denied payment\/platforming from a private corporation whose money or services they are not entitled to.\n\nThe right screams \"*Free Speech!*\" when Ben Shapiro gets shouted down from a college campus, seemingly forgetting the fact that those protestors *also* have a Constitutional right to free speech, which they are exercising. **If your definition of free speech is simply \"other people shouldn't be allowed to call me a bigot\", while you're simultaneously passing laws saying that you'll be fired for opposing Israel in your private life, or that you'll be fined for teaching anything that makes people feel \"discomfort\", how free is your speech really**?",
    "chosen": "&gt; The only free-speech related legislation I have seen in the past several years were laws restricting speech by conservative politicians.\n\nHere are some examples of recent restrictions on speech by Democrats in California\/New York. I'm sure you can find far more if you actively researched:\n\n* New York City bans employers, businesses, and landlords from refusing to use preferred pronouns of customers or employees ([source](https:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/site\/cchr\/law\/legal-guidances-gender-identity-expression.page#4)). Similar laws exist in the state of California ([source](https:\/\/kbylaw.com\/new-california-regulations-on-transgender-identity-and-expression-take-effect\/)).\n* New York state forces social media companies to provide mechanisms for reporting \"hateful\" content and to develop a plan for \"addressing\" such content ([source](https:\/\/reason.com\/2022\/12\/05\/new-york-forces-websites-to-monitor-hateful-speech-a-new-lawsuit-says-this-violates-the-first-amendment\/)). A similar law exists in California ([source](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/californias-newsom-signs-bill-requiring-social-media-firms-transparency-2022-09-14\/)).\n* New York prohibits municipalities, fire districts, volunteer fire companies, police departments and school districts from selling or displaying of symbols of \"hate\" ([source](https:\/\/legiscan.com\/NY\/text\/S04615\/2021)).\n* California requires all toy stores to have a \"gender neutral\" selection ([source](https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1084)).\n* California updated its [Foster Care Bill of Rights](https:\/\/justfacts.votesmart.org\/bill\/26907\/70744\/70386\/amends-foster-care-bill-of-rights) declaring that all dependents have the right to be referred to by their preferred name and pronouns by their caretakers.\n* [Restrictions on worship](https:\/\/floridapolitics.com\/archives\/502176-house-ready-to-vote-on-religious-freedom-bill\/) due to COVID were much more common in democrat run states than republican run ones.\n\nBasically, if you search for any bills in blue states that offer \"protections\" for LGBTQ+ people or provide more \"inclusive\" environments for \"marginalized\" groups, you'll inevitably find policies that restrict speech. \n\nWe can also look at surveys of attitudes regarding free speech. They show that democrats are likely to support such laws:\n\n* In a yougov survey, [51% of Democrats](https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/politics\/articles-reports\/2015\/05\/20\/hate-speech), compared to 37% of Republicans, support criminalizing hate speech.\n* In a Pew Research survey, [35% of Democrats](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2015\/11\/20\/40-of-millennials-ok-with-limiting-speech-offensive-to-minorities\/), compared to 18% of Republicans thinks the government should be able to prevent people from saying statements that are offensive to minorities. \n* In a Cato\/yougov survey, [52% of Democrats](https:\/\/www.cato.org\/survey-reports\/state-free-speech-tolerance-america#hate-speech), compared to 27% of Republicans, believe the government should prevent hate speech. 61% of Democrats think it should be illegal to say offensive\/insulting things about black people.\n\nWe can also look at recent key Supreme Court cases:\n\n* [Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kennedy_v._Bremerton_School_District): The court ruled 6-3 to support the right of a coach to pray after a football game. The dissenters were Sotomayor, Breyer, and Kagan.\n* [Carson v. Makin (2022)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carson_v._Makin): The court ruled 6-3 to prohibit Maine from disallowing state vouchers from being used for religious-based private schools. The dissenters were Sotomayor, Breyer, and Kagan.\n* [Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue (2020)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Espinoza_v._Montana_Department_of_Revenue): The court ruled 5-4 that a state-based scholarship program cannot discriminate against religious schools. The dissenters were Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Breyer, and Kagan.\n* [303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (2022)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/303_Creative_LLC_v._Elenis): Still a pending case, regarding whether a website designer must cater to a same sex wedding. We don't know the outcome, but it's likely to follow the same pattern as the previous cases.\n\n&gt; Ron DeSantis also wants to make it a crime to bring a minor to a Drag Show.\n\nIf we're just including \"wants\" of leaders as evidence, then we should also note that Joe Biden also _wants_ to [remove Section 230](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/09\/08\/white-house-renews-call-to-remove-section-230-liability-shield-00055771) liability protection from social media platforms. This would have a _far_ greater impact on speech than prohibiting children from drag shows.",
    "rejected": "The protestors shouting down Shapiro's speaking event, are not respecting free speech.  When a group goes to a planned speaking event and shouts to the point that the speaking event is impossible, they are doing more to *restrict* free speech, than promote it. They have 364 days and all of campus to share their ideas, but they are making Shapiro's speech impossible by constantly shouting at that event at that time."

You seem to have admitted that you didn't quite have a good understanding of nihilism. So just to add on, here's the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism) summary\n\n&gt;Moral nihilism (also known as ethical nihilism) is the meta-ethical view that nothing is intrinsically moral or immoral. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is neither inherently right nor inherently wrong.\n\nBasically a moral nihilist denies that moral expressions can be true or false, sort of like how, \"Ow!\" isn't a true or false expression, but an expression nonetheless. For example I would interpret, \"Murder is immoral,\" as, essentially really saying, \"I really, really, really don't like murder.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean that a moral nihilist has no values, or no preferences. I don't like murder, or rape, or slavery, or any of those terrible things. But at the same time, I would not say they are objectively \"bad\" in some sense.\n\nAs for [existential nihilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism)\n\n&gt;Existential nihilism is the philosophical theory that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being \"thrown\" into the universe, barred from knowing \"why\", yet compelled to invent meaning.[1] The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism, where one can potentially create his or her own subjective \"meaning\" or \"purpose\".\n\nI don't quite agree with the above summary, but it's close to my view, which I come to via [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value). Nothing has intrinsic value, not money, not food, not gold, not sex, not ice cream, nothing. Value lives in the human mind. The same for goes meaning. There is therefore no objective meaning or value to anything. I don't quite understand why this would be such a cynical thing to conclude, though. I never think, \"Life has no meaning, I should kill myself.\" - no, I think instead, \"Cool.

The truth is, it's entirely possible that Zimmernan really was in imminent danger of dying, not just a perceived danger of dying.  It's not likely, but it's possible.\n\nI like..shit I can't find the link anymore...A great article broke down (from the day-long closing statements) a good estimate of what happened.\n\n1. Zimmerman wigged out because Martin was acting weird (probably due to the marijuana) and dressed in black at night.  So he called the cops and followed him... when Martin ran, Zimmerman gained certainty that he had something to hide and was probably the burglar in the area.\n\n2. Martin wigged out because a \"crazy-ass cracker\" was following him.  For some reason, he decided after his initial flight to stay outside after he thought he got away.\n\n3. Zimmerman, on edge, asked Martin what he was doing.\n\n4. Martin, on edge, freaked out and jumped him.  This might have been partly driven by reverse racism, but we'll never know and it is not necessary that it was.\n\n5. There may or may not have been a scuffle...I lean toward \"not\" because Martin was uninjured... but Martin ended up on top of Zimmerman whose head had just hit pavement.  Whether intentional or not, Zimmerman rightly thought \"that burglar Martin\" was banging his head onto concrete...which is a reasonable thought and its potential lethality is justification for lethal self-defense... Zimmerman was not in a strong position, and might have had no safe non-lethal response.\n\n6. Bang.\n\nNote that each above assumption worsened the situation and led to the next... but each was fairly reasonable in the situation.\n\nSo many things would have prevented this.  Zimmerman not suspecting Martin.  Martin not suspecting Zimmerman.  Martin going home.  Martin not pinning Zimmerman to the ground.  And yet, Zimmerman being completely unarmed (a knife would have done as well as a gun at that range)\n\n&gt; If he hadn't had a gun, Martin wouldn't have been shot. If it were illegal and he did have it, then he could have been charged with that.\n\nI agree, but there are two uncertainties that really make this not a gun case.\n\n1. We have no reason to believe a non-gun weapon would not have caused fatality. \n\n2. We have no good reason to believe Martin would not have killed Zimmerman.

The truth is, it's entirely possible that Zimmernan really was in imminent danger of dying, not just a perceived danger of dying.  It's not likely, but it's possible.\n\nI like..shit I can't find the link anymore...A great article broke down (from the day-long closing statements) a good estimate of what happened.\n\n1. Zimmerman wigged out because Martin was acting weird (probably due to the marijuana) and dressed in black at night.  So he called the cops and followed him... when Martin ran, Zimmerman gained certainty that he had something to hide and was probably the burglar in the area.\n\n2. Martin wigged out because a \"crazy-ass cracker\" was following him.  For some reason, he decided after his initial flight to stay outside after he thought he got away.\n\n3. Zimmerman, on edge, asked Martin what he was doing.\n\n4. Martin, on edge, freaked out and jumped him.  This might have been partly driven by reverse racism, but we'll never know and it is not necessary that it was.\n\n5. There may or may not have been a scuffle...I lean toward \"not\" because Martin was uninjured... but Martin ended up on top of Zimmerman whose head had just hit pavement.  Whether intentional or not, Zimmerman rightly thought \"that burglar Martin\" was banging his head onto concrete...which is a reasonable thought and its potential lethality is justification for lethal self-defense... Zimmerman was not in a strong position, and might have had no safe non-lethal response.\n\n6. Bang.\n\nNote that each above assumption worsened the situation and led to the next... but each was fairly reasonable in the situation.\n\nSo many things would have prevented this.  Zimmerman not suspecting Martin.  Martin not suspecting Zimmerman.  Martin going home.  Martin not pinning Zimmerman to the ground.  And yet, Zimmerman being completely unarmed (a knife would have done as well as a gun at that range)\n\n&gt; If he hadn't had a gun, Martin wouldn't have been shot. If it were illegal and he did have it, then he could have been charged with that.\n\nI agree, but there are two uncertainties that really make this not a gun case.\n\n1. We have no reason to believe a non-gun weapon would not have caused fatality. \n\n2. We have no good reason to believe Martin would not have killed Zimmerman.  I suspect he would not have, but nobody could know.\n\n....but considering the ballistics, it really looks like Zimmerman had every reason to believe it was correct to use his gun at that time.\n\n", "&gt;I think blaming them for not arresting Zimmerman isn't the problem..blame them for arresting a black man in a similar situation.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not blaming anyone for anything. I'm just saying that the question I asked was worth asking. But I get your point: them not arresting the white man is a sign no one should be arrested in that situation, so arresting the black man should instead be what sets off the racism flags, rather than the other way around.\n\n&gt; (who I think is actually a Mexican?) \n\nHis nationality is American.

None of which could be used in a good prosecution case to suspend reasonable doubt.)\n\nIf this is worth discussing for anything, it's worth discussing how media affects arrest and trial.  \n\nI think he would never have been tried (regardless of race) without the media.  I think if he WERE tried without media, he would more likely have been convicted if it weren't for media attention (which makes people follow the rules).", "Thanks for the information. It makes sense to me that people don't get arrested until there's some investigation to see if there's a reason to have a trial -- I just assumed there was enough evidence at the scene, and since \"self-defense\" seemed to be unclear initially (the witness didn't know who was on top, for example, and I didn't think that the police could tell Martin was on drugs until later? After a medical exam?), my gut reaction to him not being arrested was suspicion. \n\nI didn't mean to imply that race was the *only* possible explanation for him not being arrested, just that it *is* a place where race *could* be a question. (e.g. Would the police be more likely to believe a white man in that situation acted in self-defense than a black man?) \n\n&gt;If this is worth discussing for anything, it's worth discussing how media affects arrest and trial. \n\nWell, sure, I agree this is also an important discussion, especially relevant to the trial. But in general, I think whenever an event brings difficult but relevant topics like race and gun violence to the fore, we have an opportunity as a country to get a read on the Zeitgeist (I think this word isn't typically used exactly this way, so I hope you get what I mean), evaluate it, and possibly change it. I think it's good to see examples where race could have been an issue, and is ultimately revealed not to be (though having said that, I think we *do* have a problem in this country in assuming black people are criminals, and I think black people are rightfully upset about that -- I just don't think convicting Zimmerman would have been relevant to this problem). \n\nFor clearing up the arrest issue, &amp;#8710; \n\nRegarding the original post, since I, like the OP, think gun laws should be debated regularly and thoroughly, I was surprised that I've heard so little about guns (maybe it was overshadowed by race?) in relation to this shooting. I know Zimmerman owned and carried legally, so it wasn't relevant to the trial, but that doesn't mean the carry laws are irrelevant. If he hadn't had a gun, Martin wouldn't have been shot. If it were illegal and he did have it, then he could have been charged with that. I am largely pro-gun, but carrying is where it starts to become a grey area for me because the responsibility of the gun owner to society increases a good deal when he/she brings the gun into a public space. In the case they need to use the gun, at the very least they need to be able to determine that need correctly and not shoot any bystanders. Better: they need to be able to prevent other people from taking their gun. (Rhetorical) How am I supposed to be able to trust my fellow citizens with those responsibilities? What about vigilantism (which could have been a question in the case of Zimmerman)? ", "&gt; (e.g. Would the police be more likely to believe a white man in that situation acted in self-defense than a black man?) \n\nProbably.  I think blaming them for *not* arresting Zimmerman (who I think is actually a Mexican?) isn't the problem..blame them *for* arresting a black man in a similar situation.\n\n&gt;  I was surprised that I've heard so little about guns (maybe it was overshadowed by race?) in relation to this shooting\n\nI think it has to do with the relative uncertainty as to whether irresponsible gun use was involved at all.  The truth is, it's entirely possible that Zimmernan really was in imminent danger of dying, not just a perceived danger of dying.  It's not likely, but it's possible.\n\nI like..shit I can't find the link anymore...A great article broke down (from the day-long closing statements) a good estimate of what happened.\n\n1. Zimmerman wigged out because Martin was acting weird (probably due to the marijuana) and dressed in black at night.  So he called the cops and followed him... when Martin ran, Zimmerman gained certainty that he had something to hide and was probably the burglar in the area.\n\n2. Martin wigged out because a \"crazy-ass cracker\" was following him.  For some reason, he decided after his initial flight to stay outside after he thought he got away.\n\n3. Zimmerman, on edge, asked Martin what he was doing.\n\n4. Martin, on edge, freaked out and jumped him.  This might have been partly driven by reverse racism, but we'll never know and it is not necessary that it was.\n\n5. There may or may not have been a scuffle...I lean toward \"not\" because Martin was uninjured... but Martin ended up on top of Zimmerman whose head had just hit pavement.  Whether intentional or not, Zimmerman rightly thought \"that burglar Martin\" was banging his head onto concrete...which is a reasonable thought and its potential lethality is justification for lethal self-defense... Zimmerman was not in a strong position, and might have had no safe non-lethal response.\n\n6. Bang.\n\nNote that each above assumption worsened the situation and led to the next... but each was fairly reasonable in the situation.\n\nSo many things would have prevented this.  Zimmerman not suspecting Martin.  Martin not suspecting Zimmerman.  Martin going home.  Martin not pinning Zimmerman to the ground.  And yet, Zimmerman being completely unarmed (a knife would have done as well as a gun at that range)\n\n&gt; If he hadn't had a gun, Martin wouldn't have been shot. If it were illegal and he did have it, then he could have been charged with that.\n\nI agree, but there are two uncertainties that really make this not a gun case.\n\n1. We have no reason to believe a non-gun weapon would not have caused fatality. \n\n2. We have no good reason to believe Martin would not have killed Zimmerman.  I suspect he would not have, but nobody could know.\n\n....but considering the ballistics, it really looks like Zimmerman had every reason to believe it was correct to use his gun at that time.\n\n", "&gt;I think blaming them for not arresting Zimmerman isn't the problem..blame them for arresting a black man in a similar situation.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not blaming anyone for anything. I'm just saying that the question I asked was worth asking. But I get your point: them not arresting the white man is a sign no one should be arrested in that situation, so arresting the black man should instead be what sets off the racism flags, rather than the other way around.\n\n&gt; (who I think is actually a Mexican?) \n\nHis nationality is American. His race/ethnicity has been described as \"white Hispanic\" because his father is of european descent and his mother is Peruvian. (Here's [a source](http://racerelations.about.com/od/thelegalsystem/a/The-Real-George-Zimmerman.htm), but it doesn't have any citations itself.)\n\nRe: the guns, I didn't mean to suggest that there was anything to say about the gun at the trial, I meant that in the whole media blowup about the incident, I expected for gun control to be a major topic of discussion (in particular carrying laws) -- not necessarily in the context of the events that actually transpired, but in the larger framework of \"are these laws a good idea or could we protect more people by changing them?\" The shooting in this case just (in my mind) would serve as a starting example of a negative outcome of civilians being allowed to carry handguns.\n\nI guess if I personally want to see that kind of discussion, I should just make my own CMV on it!", "Wasn't accusing you personally of blaming anyone..sorry about that :)\n\nAnd thanks for the update on his nationality.  It's hard to get straight answers right now.\n\n&gt; I meant that in the whole media blowup about the incident, I expected for gun control to be a major topic of discussion (in particular carrying laws)\n\nI got that..I guess I'm not really explaining myself well.  I don't think it's a gun control blowup any more than me shooting someone that breaks into my house would be.  It's just not clear that Trayvon Martin *wasn't* up to no good, or that George Zimmerman *wasn't* in real danger.  It's not like this was a gun accident, or a clear misuse of weapons... because of that, I don't see any foothold for a serious \"would've been better without guns\".  We don't know that.  If we could see the alternative futures and Martin would have actually ended Zimmerman's life, clearly guns had a positive influence... yet we cannot know that... Usually, big issues on something like gun control are much more clear-cut than this one.  School shootings (since nobody wants the 'most-secure' alternative of giving guns to everyone including the kids) are good for gun violence.  Rodney King for race issues.  Cops killing unarmed men on camera for police accountability. (unless you're in /r/badcopnodonut you don't see most of the \"not quite sure\" issues because they won't win you points)\n\n&gt; I guess if I personally want to see that kind of discussion, I should just make my own CMV on it!\n\nI'd be Happy to contribute if I had anything.

Think back just about half a century and a 35 and 17 year old getting married in a rural area was more helpful to running a business or farm. This kind of behavior was part of a cultural norm, but since culture has changed we now demonize this behavior.\n\nIf you were to look at sex as purely biological needs or for the purpose of reproduction (rather than life experiences, ages, demographics, etc) then sex should start for a female once her body has hit maturity. The biological window for the female becomes more limited as we apply cultural boundaries and tell women to wait on having children (Note: Having women wait is still a good idea in my mind since they ~~may not~~ don't have enough life experience to raise a child). However, this does not negate the fact that girls after reaching maturity will start to have urges or seek out sex. Just ask most girls now when they first lost their virginity. Many of them will say between the ages of 14-20. And that is a little terrifying for me to think about. I think about how much I have learned about myself in just the last year and how much I have changed/grown, but between those years you grow and change exponentially. I remember being 19 and thinking the girl I had been having sex with for over a year was going to be the one I married. And now I look back and I realize how little I knew. I am grateful that didn't work out. I see /r/relationships and /r/sex posts with people who are 16-20 freaking out about their relationship not working, and the only thing I can think is *\"You are so fucking young! You don't have to settle with someone now, you still have your whole life ahead of you!\"*\n\nThe problem is that (i.e. thinking they are too young) is the mentality we adopt. We often forget the urges we had when we were in that same position. I think the older we get the harder it is for us to remember the emotions and cravings we had as teens, and our bodies were ready, but our minds were torn. And because of this thinking we tend to blame the male (\"who should know better\"), but a 17 year old girl can be just as, if not more than, promiscuous as someone 5-10 years older; but without those extra 5-10 years of life experience we deem her unready to act in a manner that her ancestors acted before her.\n\nSo what is the lie? Is it a lie to tell a girl she isn't ready? Mentally and based on life experience probably not. Biologically she would be. Or is the lie telling the male not to be attracted to a healthy mate? A mate is more than someone to procreate with, and culturally speaking would be more companionship (whether or not you believe in evolutionary psychology you could also suggest a male will seek some level of comfort, and it would benefit the child to have a protector). But sex is a need we all (with exceptions--I don't want to discredit asexuals) experience and procreation is not mandatory to enjoy sex or fulfill a need.\n\nWhether conscious or subconscious, society has such stipulations based on perceptions they have determined acceptable.

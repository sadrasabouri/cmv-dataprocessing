You seem to have admitted that you didn't quite have a good understanding of nihilism. So just to add on, here's the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism) summary\n\n&gt;Moral nihilism (also known as ethical nihilism) is the meta-ethical view that nothing is intrinsically moral or immoral. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is neither inherently right nor inherently wrong.\n\nBasically a moral nihilist denies that moral expressions can be true or false, sort of like how, \"Ow!\" isn't a true or false expression, but an expression nonetheless. For example I would interpret, \"Murder is immoral,\" as, essentially really saying, \"I really, really, really don't like murder.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean that a moral nihilist has no values, or no preferences. I don't like murder, or rape, or slavery, or any of those terrible things. But at the same time, I would not say they are objectively \"bad\" in some sense.\n\nAs for [existential nihilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism)\n\n&gt;Existential nihilism is the philosophical theory that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being \"thrown\" into the universe, barred from knowing \"why\", yet compelled to invent meaning.[1] The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism, where one can potentially create his or her own subjective \"meaning\" or \"purpose\".\n\nI don't quite agree with the above summary, but it's close to my view, which I come to via [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value). Nothing has intrinsic value, not money, not food, not gold, not sex, not ice cream, nothing. Value lives in the human mind. The same for goes meaning. There is therefore no objective meaning or value to anything. I don't quite understand why this would be such a cynical thing to conclude, though. I never think, \"Life has no meaning, I should kill myself.\" - no, I think instead, \"Cool.

Police often take into account how traumatic it is, and whether it is likely that the person committed a crime... They probably take flight risk into account as well.  Lacking an arrest warrant, police arrest on probable cause.  \n\nSince he was the one who called the police, and his story was self-defense, and there was no evidence at the time that suggested otherwise, AND he wasn't a flight risk, it makes perfect sense not to arrest or press charges at first... though I would not have faulted a police officer who chose to do so.\n\n&gt; I thought that's what trials were for.\n\nTrials are for when prosecution *knows* (or thinks they know) you committed a crime.  Arrests come from warrant or probable cause.  You cannot be detained for any length of time without being charged.  Prosecution will not charge you unless they have compelling evidence that you may be guilty.\n\n&gt; I always felt that's where the focus of the racial discussion should have been, rather than on whether Zimmerman was profiling or not.\n\nBut even with the police behavior... it just doesn't make sense to blame race above all the other factors.

I feel the only reason we had a trial was the media attention.  The prosecution's case was well fought, but it SUCKED.  Lacking any way to suspend reasonable doubt, Zimmerman had one of the most solid defences I've ever heard of in a courtroom.  He had a story that fit the forensics and the testimony of the only witness who actually saw anything (the only conflicts are lack of skull damage on Zimmerman, lack of Zimmerman's DNA on Martin's hands, and the phone-girl Deedee.  None of which could be used in a good prosecution case to suspend reasonable doubt.)\n\nIf this is worth discussing for anything, it's worth discussing how media affects arrest and trial.  \n\nI think he would never have been tried (regardless of race) without the media.

After a medical exam?), my gut reaction to him not being arrested was suspicion. \n\nI didn't mean to imply that race was the *only* possible explanation for him not being arrested, just that it *is* a place where race *could* be a question. (e.g. Would the police be more likely to believe a white man in that situation acted in self-defense than a black man?) \n\n&gt;If this is worth discussing for anything, it's worth discussing how media affects arrest and trial. \n\nWell, sure, I agree this is also an important discussion, especially relevant to the trial. But in general, I think whenever an event brings difficult but relevant topics like race and gun violence to the fore, we have an opportunity as a country to get a read on the Zeitgeist (I think this word isn't typically used exactly this way, so I hope you get what I mean), evaluate it, and possibly change it. I think it's good to see examples where race could have been an issue, and is ultimately revealed not to be (though having said that, I think we *do* have a problem in this country in assuming black people are criminals, and I think black people are rightfully upset about that -- I just don't think convicting Zimmerman would have been relevant to this problem). \n\nFor clearing up the arrest issue, &amp;#8710; \n\nRegarding the original post, since I, like the OP, think gun laws should be debated regularly and thoroughly, I was surprised that I've heard so little about guns (maybe it was overshadowed by race?) in relation to this shooting. I know Zimmerman owned and carried legally, so it wasn't relevant to the trial, but that doesn't mean the carry laws are irrelevant. If he hadn't had a gun, Martin wouldn't have been shot. If it were illegal and he did have it, then he could have been charged with that. I am largely pro-gun, but carrying is where it starts to become a grey area for me because the responsibility of the gun owner to society increases a good deal when he/she brings the gun into a public space. In the case they need to use the gun, at the very least they need to be able to determine that need correctly and not shoot any bystanders. Better: they need to be able to prevent other people from taking their gun. (Rhetorical) How am I supposed to be able to trust my fellow citizens with those responsibilities?

Zimmerman wigged out because Martin was acting weird (probably due to the marijuana) and dressed in black at night.  So he called the cops and followed him... when Martin ran, Zimmerman gained certainty that he had something to hide and was probably the burglar in the area.\n\n2. Martin wigged out because a \"crazy-ass cracker\" was following him.  For some reason, he decided after his initial flight to stay outside after he thought he got away.\n\n3. Zimmerman, on edge, asked Martin what he was doing.\n\n4. Martin, on edge, freaked out and jumped him.  This might have been partly driven by reverse racism, but we'll never know and it is not necessary that it was.\n\n5. There may or may not have been a scuffle...I lean toward \"not\" because Martin was uninjured... but Martin ended up on top of Zimmerman whose head had just hit pavement.  Whether intentional or not, Zimmerman rightly thought \"that burglar Martin\" was banging his head onto concrete...which is a reasonable thought and its potential lethality is justification for lethal self-defense... Zimmerman was not in a strong position, and might have had no safe non-lethal response.\n\n6.

We have no reason to believe a non-gun weapon would not have caused fatality. \n\n2. We have no good reason to believe Martin would not have killed Zimmerman.

Think back just about half a century and a 35 and 17 year old getting married in a rural area was more helpful to running a business or farm. This kind of behavior was part of a cultural norm, but since culture has changed we now demonize this behavior.\n\nIf you were to look at sex as purely biological needs or for the purpose of reproduction (rather than life experiences, ages, demographics, etc) then sex should start for a female once her body has hit maturity. The biological window for the female becomes more limited as we apply cultural boundaries and tell women to wait on having children (Note: Having women wait is still a good idea in my mind since they ~~may not~~ don't have enough life experience to raise a child). However, this does not negate the fact that girls after reaching maturity will start to have urges or seek out sex. Just ask most girls now when they first lost their virginity. Many of them will say between the ages of 14-20. And that is a little terrifying for me to think about. I think about how much I have learned about myself in just the last year and how much I have changed/grown, but between those years you grow and change exponentially. I remember being 19 and thinking the girl I had been having sex with for over a year was going to be the one I married. And now I look back and I realize how little I knew. I am grateful that didn't work out. I see /r/relationships and /r/sex posts with people who are 16-20 freaking out about their relationship not working, and the only thing I can think is *\"You are so fucking young! You don't have to settle with someone now, you still have your whole life ahead of you!\"*\n\nThe problem is that (i.e. thinking they are too young) is the mentality we adopt. We often forget the urges we had when we were in that same position. I think the older we get the harder it is for us to remember the emotions and cravings we had as teens, and our bodies were ready, but our minds were torn. And because of this thinking we tend to blame the male (\"who should know better\"), but a 17 year old girl can be just as, if not more than, promiscuous as someone 5-10 years older; but without those extra 5-10 years of life experience we deem her unready to act in a manner that her ancestors acted before her.\n\nSo what is the lie? Is it a lie to tell a girl she isn't ready? Mentally and based on life experience probably not. Biologically she would be. Or is the lie telling the male not to be attracted to a healthy mate? A mate is more than someone to procreate with, and culturally speaking would be more companionship (whether or not you believe in evolutionary psychology you could also suggest a male will seek some level of comfort, and it would benefit the child to have a protector). But sex is a need we all (with exceptions--I don't want to discredit asexuals) experience and procreation is not mandatory to enjoy sex or fulfill a need.\n\nWhether conscious or subconscious, society has such stipulations based on perceptions they have determined acceptable. Yes society sexualizes just about everything (rule 34 &amp; 35), but they also have notions about what is beneficial to a relationship. Even if some are just no strings attached.","subreddit":"changemyview","link_id":"t3_22a37m","archived":true,"score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t3_22a37m","retrieved_on":1433222596,"subreddit_id":"t5_2w2s8","downs":0}

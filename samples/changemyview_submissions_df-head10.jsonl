{"retrieved_on":1441204863,"ups":67,"media":null,"selftext":"When someone is in high school, it does not make sense to have a committed romantic relationship. Romantic relationship is defined as a mutual agreement of exclusivity in dating, and being referred to as together.\n\nThe first point I have is that in a purely practical sense, dating should be seen from a breadth first approach. It is more pragmatic to date many people and learn what your particular tastes are than to learn it by stumbling through a series of relationships that fall apart and tripping right into the next one. This is emotionally taxing.\n\nSecond, as teenagers have not matured enough yet to what they will be as adults. You can't really understand the significance of that intimacy at that time. One just is not ready until a later age\n\nThird, relationships are distracting, expensive and time consuming. High school is often what decides the course of someone's life, and it is not wise to mess with something that powerful. I have seen many people throw their lives away for their boyfriend or girlfriend, and it seems that it just is not worth the risk.\n\nEDIT: Please note I am only saying that people shouldn't get into serious relationships, not that dating should stop altogether.\n\nAnswer this and I will be convinced; Is it vital that someone gets relationship experience in high school? Would in not be bennifical to date noncommittally until after graduation?\n\nTo support this I point to the statistic brought up by u/tomrhod:\n\n&gt;The key is that the research shows that starting in the 1980s education, specifically a college degree for women, began to create a substantial divergence in marital outcomes, with the divorce rate for college-educated women dropping to about 20 percent, half the rate for non-college educated women. Even this is more complex, since the non-college educated women marry younger and are poorer than their college grad peers. These two factors, age at marriage and income level, have strong relationships to divorce rates; the older the partners and the higher the income, the more likely the couple stays married.\n... A closer look at even these lower rates indicate that there are really two separate groups with very different rates: a woman who is over 25, has a college degree, and an independent income has only a 20 percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce; a woman who marries younger than 25, without a college degree and lacking an independent income has a 40 percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce.\n\nPlease, CMV\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThe multitude of stories changed my view.

To change my view you will need to either convince me that there is a significant fundamental difference between the two, or that it\u2019s ok to kill dogs for fun. \n\nAs someone who really enjoys eating meat, I would really like for my view to be changed.  I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that it\u2019s ok to continue eating meat, but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.\n\nI\u2019d like to pre-emptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling.\n\n*1.  People need to eat to survive; therefore eating meat is morally acceptable.*\n\nI do not find this answer compelling because we do not have to eat *meat* to survive.  We can live perfectly healthy lives without eating any meat.  Eating meat is certainly enjoyable to many people but that is hardly a justification.  Some people enjoy killing dogs and I don\u2019t consider that an acceptable justification.\n\n*2.  Eating meat is natural.  We have been doing it since we were cavemen.*\n\nRaping people is also natural and we have also been doing it since we were cavemen.\n\n*3.  We have domesticated some animals to the point where they cannot survive in nature.  If we were to not raise them for consumption, they would go extinct.*\n\nI am not sure that I am really opposed to the extinction of species that cannot survive in nature, but if I were, I suppose we could make a small nature preserve where 1000 cows, pigs, and chickens live.  If you are going to complain about the cost, rest assured that the cost would be far outweighed by our consumption of more efficient food.\n\n*4.  If the animals are raised in a humane way and slaughtered painlessly and without causing them any fear, what\u2019s the problem?*\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure why I feel like it is wrong.  But I do know that if someone liked to adopt puppies, treat them humanely, and then execute them in a painless manner just for fun, it seems morally reprehensible to me.  Maybe someone can explain why I feel this way or convince me that it\u2019s ok.\n\n*5.  Killing dogs for fun is ok because they don\u2019t have a soul or aren\u2019t self-aware or something like that.*\n\nI don\u2019t think there is anything fundamentally different about a dog and a human that would make it ok to kill one and not the other without a pretty good reason.\n\n*6.  What about fish?  What about eggs?  What about spinach?  It\u2019s alive too.  You have to draw the line somewhere.*\n\nThat\u2019s true.  I\u2019m not sure where the line should be but I do know that pigs are as smart and adorable as dogs so I don\u2019t see why any rules of morality should extend to one and not the other.\n\n\n**EDITS**\n*7.  Animals kill other animals for food.  Is that immoral?*\n\nMany animals do not have a choice but to eat meat. In those cases it is not immoral for them to kill for food. In the cases of animals that are perfectly capable of subsisting without killing, I would say that they are behaving in an immoral way, but I don't blame them since they probably lack the reasoning capacity to think about this situation from the other creature's point of view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
